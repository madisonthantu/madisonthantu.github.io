title: Weeks 1-2
---

The first requirement of any research project is determining what it is that you want to research or, better yet, identifying what questions that you want to answer. As such, my research experience first began with a phase of ideation.

This ideation process began in Fall 2022 when I took the course *COMS 6998: Fair and Robust Algorithms* with Dr. Zemel. Students were tasked with designing and executing a research project. Alongside my research partner, I surveyed numerous topics within the domain of algorithmic fairness and robustness, including subgroup fairness, intersectionality as applied to machine learning, and recommender systems (RSs), to name a few. After deciding to pursue a research project in the latter domain, the ideation process continued, as the field of RSs is notoriously complex and there are numerous avenues that can be taken in researching these systems. As such, these first few weeks were devoted to familiarizing myself with the interests, concerns, and implementations making headway in the academic community w.r.t. RSs.
