After surveying the field of RS literature, my research partner and I identified several RS properties that were of interest to us: diversity, user behavior homogenization, and user fairness. 

After the ideation phase, the next step was to outline our project design, during which we determined our:
1. *Primary research questions*: 
   1. What is the triadic relationship between accuracy, exploration, and fairness in the RS model, and how do these dynamics and their oftentimes competing objectives interact with one another and evolve in a dynamical ecosystem?
   2. How do different recommendation algorithms, with different prioritizations of accuracy versus diversity, influence that dynamics listed in (1)?
2. *Work plan and timetable*: We outlined a timeline for our research, setting specific milestones to ensure that we remained on track and intentional with our work.
3. *Proposed results*: Due to the numerous research approaches that can be taken, my partner and I generated a list of proposed results, outlining our metrics of interest, which included:
   1. Accuracy measurements: Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE),
   2. Diversity-related measurements: Diversity, novelty, and serendipity,
   3. Homogenization measurements: User interaction similarity and user recommendation similarity, and 
   4. Fairness measurements: MSE per user

We used this explicit outlining of our research design and timeline as a guideline for the remaining duration of our course project.
